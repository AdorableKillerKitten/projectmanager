# projectmanager
Basic project management app, todo list timetable, google calendar sync and note taking 

I want to build a simple prpject manager both as a learning experience and because the ones available seem to be either
1. too bloated (I am looking at you notion) 
2. Or they want my money which they wont get :) Since my projectgs are all non professional in nature

cApp is currently concerned with the GUI 
todoist.cpp is a testConsole application for the Task class which will be used for the todo Widget 

beyond that not much here :) 

I'll later add a complete documentation to the project when thing pick up a little more. 

Cheers,
